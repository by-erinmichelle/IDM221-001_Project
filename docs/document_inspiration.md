##Document Inspiration

####[Studio Marani](http://www.studiomarani.it/en/#)  

I like that each page is a photo from one of the studio’s projects; there is no border because the photo covers the entire page. Also, the photos are not entirely still, there is something moving in each one (i.e. the boys hair in the first photo). I think that this movement and how the photos fill the page makes the design more immersive for the user. It feels like you are looking at the motion in real time rather than just looking at a computer screen. I also like that the text is very minimal because it makes the design look clean and not cluttered. When you view the project details there is more text but its separated in small chunks between photos so it’s not overwhelming.

I like the tile design of the projects because I think it makes it easier to see the designer’s portfolio and the user can view the details of whichever project instead of having to scroll through every single one. I also like that when the mouse hovers over a tile it changes to a transparent gray tile with the project title. I like this because the user can see a little more information about the project without having to read all the details, and the transparency keeps the project photo in view. However, I don't really like the placement of some of the tiles. Some of the darker tiles are placed next to each other and they blend together so it is harder to distinguish them.

I mostly like the home page of this site. The menu bar is at the bottom of the page which I like because I think it draws more attention to the restaurant name and the image of food. I also like that the menu bar is simple with small black caps and it is stretches the width of the food pictured above it. I don’t really like that the image stays in the background as you scroll farther down. I think it’s distracting and makes the information thats layered on top appear much more cluttered. More specifically, there is a “Latest News” section where the text is sitting only on the background image rather than on a more solid background like the other sections, which made it harder to read.

I really like how this site is organized. The work is separated into categories (furniture, lighting, etc.) and shown as tiles but they aren’t scattered or randomly placed, they line up as two halves of the page so everything is easy to find. I also like the design of the individual tiles because each one shows a different color when the mouse hovers over it and the colors are coordinated with the tile image. The different colors keep the projects even more categorized which adds to the organization. I like the thick block text used in the headers because I think it fits with the style of the site as a whole, but I do wish there were a little more space between the letters especially in the menu because it looks very tight.
